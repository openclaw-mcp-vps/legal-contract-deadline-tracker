# Build Task: legal-contract-deadline-tracker

Build a complete, production-ready Next.js 15 App Router application.

PROJECT: legal-contract-deadline-tracker
HEADLINE: Never miss contract renewals and legal deadlines again
WHAT: Extracts key dates from uploaded contracts and legal documents, sends smart reminders before deadlines, and tracks renewal opportunities
WHY: Small businesses lose thousands annually from missed contract deadlines and auto-renewals they forgot to cancel
WHO PAYS: Small business owners, freelancers, consultants
NICHE: legal-compliance
PRICE: $$15/mo

ARCHITECTURE SPEC:
A Next.js web app with document upload, AI-powered date extraction using OpenAI, automated email reminders via cron jobs, and subscription billing through Lemon Squeezy. Users upload contracts, the system extracts deadlines using OCR and LLM parsing, stores them in a database, and sends timely notifications.

PLANNED FILES:
- app/page.tsx
- app/dashboard/page.tsx
- app/upload/page.tsx
- app/api/upload/route.ts
- app/api/extract-dates/route.ts
- app/api/webhooks/lemonsqueezy/route.ts
- app/api/cron/send-reminders/route.ts
- lib/document-parser.ts
- lib/email-service.ts
- lib/database.ts
- components/DocumentUpload.tsx
- components/DeadlinesList.tsx
- components/PricingCard.tsx
- prisma/schema.prisma

DEPENDENCIES: next, tailwindcss, prisma, @prisma/client, openai, pdf-parse, mammoth, nodemailer, @lemonsqueezy/lemonsqueezy.js, uploadthing, date-fns, react-hook-form, zod, lucide-react

REQUIREMENTS:
- Next.js 15 with App Router (app/ directory)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4
- shadcn/ui components (npx shadcn@latest init, then add needed components)
- Dark theme ONLY — background #0d1117, no light mode
- Stripe Payment Link for payments (hosted checkout — use the URL directly as the Buy button href)
- Landing page that converts: hero, problem, solution, pricing, FAQ
- The actual tool/feature behind a paywall (cookie-based access after purchase)
- Mobile responsive
- SEO meta tags, Open Graph tags
- /api/health endpoint that returns {"status":"ok"}
- NO HEAVY ORMs: Do NOT use Prisma, Drizzle, TypeORM, Sequelize, or Mongoose. If the tool needs persistence, use direct SQL via `pg` (Postgres) or `better-sqlite3` (local), or just filesystem JSON. Reason: these ORMs require schema files and codegen steps that fail on Vercel when misconfigured.
- INTERNAL FILE DISCIPLINE: Every internal import (paths starting with `@/`, `./`, or `../`) MUST refer to a file you actually create in this build. If you write `import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card"`, then `components/ui/card.tsx` MUST exist with a real `export const Card` (or `export default Card`). Before finishing, scan all internal imports and verify every target file exists. Do NOT use shadcn/ui patterns unless you create every component from scratch — easier path: write all UI inline in the page that uses it.
- DEPENDENCY DISCIPLINE: Every package imported in any .ts, .tsx, .js, or .jsx file MUST be
  listed in package.json dependencies (or devDependencies for build-only). Before finishing,
  scan all source files for `import` statements and verify every external package (anything
  not starting with `.` or `@/`) appears in package.json. Common shadcn/ui peers that MUST
  be added if used:
  - lucide-react, clsx, tailwind-merge, class-variance-authority
  - react-hook-form, zod, @hookform/resolvers
  - @radix-ui/* (for any shadcn component)
- After running `npm run build`, if you see "Module not found: Can't resolve 'X'", add 'X'
  to package.json dependencies and re-run npm install + npm run build until it passes.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (create .env.example):
- NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK  (full URL, e.g. https://buy.stripe.com/test_XXX)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY  (pk_test_... or pk_live_...)
- STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET  (set when webhook is wired)

BUY BUTTON RULE: the Buy button's href MUST be `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK`
used as-is — do NOT construct URLs from a product ID, do NOT prepend any base URL,
do NOT wrap it in an embed iframe. The link opens Stripe's hosted checkout directly.

After creating all files:
1. Run: npm install
2. Run: npm run build
3. Fix any build errors
4. Verify the build succeeds with exit code 0

Do NOT use placeholder text. Write real, helpful content for the landing page
and the tool itself. The tool should actually work and provide value.
